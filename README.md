# Nick's Recipe Book
Nick's Recipe Book was made using Express, MongoDB, EJS, HTML, CSS, Materialize, bCrypt, and deployed using Heroku. All the data was manually added, consisting recipe's of various sources from hand-written note cards to delicious looking things from around the web.

## Approach
The first thing that was done and ready to go was setting up the express server, and getting all the routes set up and working. After that the create route was added, as being able to fill and display the database is what this whole project is about! From there the styling was the next big goal, having it look good and display all parts of the recipe in a easy-to-read format is important, no long stories here! Just right to the info.

## Future Additions
Given more time there are a few features I would like to add, the biggest being able to credit who submits what recipe, and the owner of the recipe being able to edit and delete what they post. Another feature would be the ability to create a "favorites" list to save things you like for easier access! As more recipes get added, it becomes more important to be able to see exactly what you like.
